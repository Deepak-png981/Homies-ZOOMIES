# Homies-ZOOMIES
Greetings to the Readers ! I have created website to deliver a platform to the user in which one can easily communicate and interact with larger groups all around. Specifically its a replica similar to zoom and other similar applications.
<br />
<br />
A web version of zoom app made using Express JS, Node JS, Peer JS , Vanilla JS ,Socket IO and a little bit of BootStrap
<br />
Where individulas can talk on video call, share content, hold meetings, classes or can simply chat.
Using these basic features can bring about tremendous beneficial aspects:
<br />
* For Video Chit-Chats among HOMIES
* PROFESSIONAL SECTOR
* EDUCATIONAL SECTOR
